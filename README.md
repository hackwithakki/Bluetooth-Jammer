# Tutorial: Bluetooth-Jammer

This project is a **Bluetooth jammer** designed to disrupt nearby Bluetooth devices.
It allows users to *scan for available devices*, *select a specific target*, and then launch a powerful **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack**.
By using *multiple concurrent processes* to flood the target with data packets, it aims to effectively jam and disrupt the device's Bluetooth connection.
